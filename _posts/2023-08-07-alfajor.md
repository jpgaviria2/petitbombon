Sure! I can provide a description for an alfajor, but please note that I cannot directly provide images. Instead, I can describe the type of image that would complement the description well. You can then source or create the images based on the description.

**Alfajor**

**Description:**  
Succumb to the allure of our traditional alfajor â€“ a beloved South American delicacy. Two tender, shortbread-like cookies come together to sandwich a generous layer of creamy dulce de leche. The edges are artfully rolled in delicate coconut shavings, providing a subtle crunch and tropical flavor. Each bite transports you to the cobblestone streets of Buenos Aires, where alfajores reign as the treat of choice. Perfect with a cup of coffee or as a sweet end to your meal.
